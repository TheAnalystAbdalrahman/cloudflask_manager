## Project Overview

CloudFlask Manager is designed to streamline the deployment and management of microservices using a combination of Flask for the backend, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and AWS for cloud infrastructure. This project serves as an example of implementing a DevOps pipeline and cloud infrastructure management.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used for building the backend of the application.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into a Docker image.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform used to manage the deployment and scaling of Docker containers.
- **AWS**: Cloud service provider used for hosting and managing the Kubernetes cluster.
- **eksctl**: Command-line tool for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters on AWS EKS.
- **kubectl**: Command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

## Features

- **Flask Backend**: Provides the core functionality of the application.
- **Docker Containerization**: Ensures consistent development and production environments.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Manages the deployment and scaling of the application.
- **AWS Integration**: Uses AWS services to host the Kubernetes cluster.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured.
- [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/) installed.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed.
- Docker installed and configured.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/cloudflask_manager.git
cd cloudflask_manager


### Configure AWS CLI

```bash
aws configure
```

Follow the prompts to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name (`us-east-1`), and Default output format (`json`).

### Create EKS Cluster

```bash
eksctl create cluster --name cloudflask-manager --region us-east-1 --nodes 3 --node-type t3.medium
```

### Build and Push Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t cloudflask-manager .
docker tag cloudflask-manager:latest <your-dockerhub-username>/cloudflask-manager:latest
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/cloudflask-manager:latest
```

### Apply Kubernetes Configurations

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

## Usage

After deploying, you can interact with the application using the provided service endpoints. To access the application, retrieve the service's external IP address:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

## Deployment

The project is deployed using Kubernetes on AWS EKS. The deployment configuration is defined in the `deployment.yaml` file, and the service configuration is defined in the `service.yaml` file. These files describe how to deploy and expose the application.
